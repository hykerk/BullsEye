I am aware there are problems with how this is being uploaded and submitted. I ran into several problems with my macbook air and trying to do all of this. I did not realize that I was meant to start the github part at the beginning so that commitments could register. I have an old macbook and it took me several days and troubleshooting to get xCode to download on it at all. I will learn from these mistakes and get the project to upload correctly for next time.
